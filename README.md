Hello, thanks to play with my game!

If they are errors/bugs and so on, you report it please.
And if your window is in Fullscreen, press : Alt + Enter.

For play with it, you must extract zip file according to your system (Windows/Linux/MacOs) :
Locate the zipped folder that you want to unzip (extract) files or folders from.
Do one of the following:
To unzip a single file or folder, open the zipped folder, then drag the file or folder from the zipped folder to a new location.
To unzip all the contents of the zipped folder, press and hold (or right-click) the folder, select Extract All..., and then follow the instructions.

Good time and bye!
